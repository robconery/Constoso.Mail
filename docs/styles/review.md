# Code Review Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for conducting code reviews in our project. The goal is to ensure high-quality code, maintainability, and collaboration among team members.

## General Guidelines

  - All code should adhere to the project's coding standards and style guide.
  - Code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
  - All code should be properly tested, with sufficient test coverage for new features or changes.
  - Code should be documented, including comments and JSDoc annotations.
  - Pull requests (PRs) should be used for all code changes, and they should include a clear description of the changes made, the purpose of the changes, and any relevant issue numbers.
  - Code should be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging into the main branch.
  - All code should be written in English to ensure clarity for all team members.

## Documentation

  - All code should be well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of complex logic.
  - API endpoints should be documented in the `docs/api.md` file.
  - Any significant architectural decisions should be documented in the `docs/architecture.md` file.
  - All changes should be accompanied by relevant documentation updates to ensure clarity for future developers.
  - All public methods and classes should have JSDoc comments to provide clear API documentation.
  - The README file should provide an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage examples.
  - All documentation should be written in Markdown format and follow the project's style guide for consistency.
  - Documentation should be kept up-to-date with code changes to avoid discrepancies.

## Comment Guidelines

  - Comments should be used to clarify complex logic, explain the purpose of functions or classes, and provide context for why certain decisions were made.
  - Comments should not be used to explain simple or self-explanatory code.
  - Comments should be concise and relevant, avoiding unnecessary verbosity.
  - Comments should be written in English to ensure clarity for all team members.
  - Comments should follow the project's style guide for consistency in formatting and tone.
  - Comments should be placed above the code they refer to, using a consistent format (e.g. `//` for single-line comments, `/* ... */` for multi-line comments).
  - Avoid using comments to disable code; instead, remove or refactor the code as necessary.
  - Comments should not be used to explain the "what" of the code, as this should be clear from the code itself; instead, focus on the "why" and any important context.

## Code Review Process

  1. **Pull Request Creation**:
   Developers should create a pull request (PR) for any changes they wish to merge into the main branch. The PR should include a clear description of the changes made, the purpose of the changes, and any relevant issue numbers.
  2. **Assign Reviewers**:
   The developer should assign at least one reviewer to the PR. Reviewers should be familiar with the codebase and the specific area of the changes.
  3. **Review Guidelines**:
   Reviewers should follow these guidelines when reviewing code:

     - Check for adherence to the project's coding standards and style guide.
     - Ensure that the code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
     - Verify that the code is properly tested, with sufficient test coverage for new features or changes.
     - Look for potential bugs, performance issues, or security vulnerabilities.
     - Ensure that the code is properly documented, including comments and JSDoc annotations.
     - Check that the code does not introduce any breaking changes unless explicitly intended and documented.
  4. **Feedback and Discussion**:
   Reviewers should provide constructive feedback on the PR. This can include suggestions for improvements, questions about the implementation, or requests for additional tests or documentation. Discussion should be respectful and focused on improving the code quality.
  5. **Addressing Feedback**:
   The developer should address the feedback provided by the reviewers. This may involve making changes to the code, adding tests, or updating documentation. Once the feedback has been addressed, the developer should push the changes to the PR branch.
  6. **Approval and Merging**:
   Once all feedback has been addressed and the reviewers are satisfied with the changes, they should approve the PR. The developer can then merge the PR into the main branch. If there are any merge conflicts, they should be resolved before merging.
  7. **Post-Merge Actions**:
   After merging, the developer should ensure that the main branch is stable and that all tests pass. If necessary, the developer should also update any relevant documentation or notify the team about the changes made.
