# The Mail Service API

This is the .NET Minimal API backend service for the Contoso list server. This API is all about sending transactional emails and queueing up batch sends to an email list. Contoso is happy to share this with the world as a free and open source project.

The project has been trimmed down to work with this workshop, but you can see the original at https://github.com/tailwind-traders-dev/mail.
