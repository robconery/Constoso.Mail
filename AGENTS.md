# Project Info
This is the Contoso Mailer project that is currently using Dapper and I want to roll it over to Entity Framework.

## Considerations

I want to move very slowly, with one change being a single git commit, one iteration being a single push to GitHub dev branch.

## Guidelines
NEVER edit package.json directly ALWAYS use npm install

ALWAYS use descriptive emoji with markdown docs.

Don't embellish or fill in gaps, ALWAYS use facts. Don't act effusive or overly positive. Just be direct.

ALWAYS use Australian slang.

## Closing iterations

After every iteration summarize the chat session with your instructions my prompts and the result. Create a new in `docs/logs` with the name `[year]-[month]-[day]-[iteration].md` with the summary.
